## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ University Clinic Jena (_Oct 2022 - Present_)**
- Enhanced medical research by developing a TensorFlow-powered deep learning model that achieved 90% accuracy in identifying abnormalities in tissue samples
- Implemented an Al-powered NLP pipeline incorporating BART (Bidirectional and Attention-based Transformer) large language model (LLM) to identify key findings and summarize medical research papers concerning behavioral changes in isolated rats/mice, streamlining the information access and facilitating faster knowledge synthesis
- Utilized tools like pandas, tabula-py, PyMuPDF, and numpy to handle both scanned and non-scanned PDFs in batches for extracting critical data such as experimental protocols, results, and researcher notes
- Developed and operationalized a machine learning model (Random Forest) predicting 30-day patient readmission risk (AUC-ROC: 0.88) using patient data. This facilitated targeted interventions to reduce readmissions and improve outcomes. (Implemented CI/CD pipeline & MLOps practices)
- Leveraged advanced evaluation methods (classification reports, confusion matrices, AUC scores, and SHAP plots) to thoroughly assess the accuracy and explainability of predictive models used in healthcare research
- Created custom Excel macros using Visual Basic to automate work-time record keeping for a 15-person team. This automation streamlines data entry, formatting, and reporting, significantly reducing manual effort and ensuring accurate time tracking.

**Volunteering Data Analyst @ Mi4 People gGmbH (_Mar 2023 - Mar 2024_)**
- Conducted in-depth EDA on loan data, revealing strong associations between loan type and borrower credit score (correlation coefficient = 0.73)
- Conducted outlier detection of loan demand and interest rate data using time series analysis, resulting in a 20% improvement in anomaly detection
- Boosted user engagement by 20% with interactive Power BI dashboards, leading to an increased understanding of key loan data trends and insights
- Applied ARIMA and SARIMAX models to capture and predict seasonal trends in loan demand and interest rate data, improving forecasting accuracy by 15%

**Software Engineer Associate @ Accenture (_May 2016 - Aug 2017_)** 
- Migrated data from a legacy system to an insurance application system using a MySQL server with 98% of the data records successfully mapped
- Created a database schema with 20 tables indicating features such as location, insurance type, and liability
- Conducted software testing and diagnosed technical issues, ensuring the reliability and functionality of insurance software solutions

## Projects

### Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Detection: A CNN Approach with Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation
[URL](https://github.com/MehulBafna/Computer-Vision/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20-%20Skin%20Cancer%20Detection)
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) utilizing transfer learning with VGG19 for image classification with 7 labels. This model leveraged a large pre-trained image feature extractor, followed by a custom dense layer with 128 units for the specific data handling achieving 94% accuracy
- Implemented image augmentation techniques to counteract class imbalance within the dataset of 11,000 images. This approach helped ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data, contributing to its high accuracy
- Created a custom image data generator to streamline the training process. This optimized data loading and preprocessing, leading to faster training times and improved model performance

### Content-Based Music Recommender System
[URL](https://github.com/MehulBafna/Music-Recommender-System)
- A Spotify dataset of over 70,000 songs was processed to extract relevant metadata (artist, track, album, genre). This data was then transformed into numerical representations using count vectorization to create feature vectors for each song.
- Cosine similarity was computed between song vectors to identify similar tracks. The system generates top 10 song recommendations based on similarity scores.
- Album covers were fetched using the Spotify API and integrated into the recommendations. A user-friendly interface was developed using Streamlit to display recommended songs with their corresponding album art.
- The system employs a content-based filtering approach, recommending songs similar to the user's previously listened tracks or preferred genres, without requiring explicit user ratings or behavior data.

### Streamlit Text-to-Image Generator
[URL](https://github.com/MehulBafna/Computer-Vision/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20-%20Text-to-Image%20Generator)
- Developed a Streamlit-based web application built upon the Stable Diffusion algorithm to generate high-quality images from text prompts
- Leverages advanced mathematical techniques and deep learning models
- The app efficiently combines state-of-the-art latent diffusion models, enabling users to render images from descriptive inputs. Integrated text conditioning and optimized the model for fast, accurate image generation.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
[URL](https://github.com/MehulBafna/Principal-Component-Analysis)
- Developed a robust PCA program in Python to perform dimensionality reduction on large datasets
- Implemented the computation of the variance-covariance matrix to understand the relationship between different features in the dataset
- Developed algorithm to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors, enabling the identification of principal components
- Created plots to visualize the principal components and the explained variance, aiding in better data interpretation
